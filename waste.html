    <h1>Waste Management</h1>
    <img src="Involvement.png" alt="Waste Management Visual" class="main-image">

    <p>
      Waste management is more than just disposal—it's about rethinking our relationship with materials. In a circular economy, waste becomes a resource. Youth across Goa and beyond are stepping up to lead this transformation through innovation, education, and community action.
    </p>

    <h2>Segregation at Source</h2>
    <p>
      Proper segregation is the foundation of effective waste management. By separating biodegradable, recyclable, and hazardous waste at the point of generation, we reduce contamination and increase recovery. Schools are introducing color-coded bins, and student-led audits are helping families adopt better habits.
    </p>

    <h2>Plastic Waste Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Plastic pollution is one of the most visible environmental challenges. Youth innovators are creating eco-bricks, reusable packaging, and awareness campaigns to reduce single-use plastics. Local beach cleanups are not just about collection—they’re about storytelling, data collection, and policy advocacy.
    </p>

    <h2>E-Waste Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      Electronic waste contains both valuable metals and toxic substances. Youth groups are organizing e-waste drives in schools and colleges, partnering with certified recyclers, and educating peers about the dangers of improper disposal. Some are even building DIY gadgets from salvaged components.
    </p>

    <h2>Organic Waste & Composting</h2>
    <p>
      Organic waste makes up a large portion of household garbage. Composting turns this waste into nutrient-rich soil. Rooftop gardens, hostel compost pits, and vermicomposting workshops are empowering students to close the food loop and reconnect with nature.
    </p>

    <h2>Upcycling & Creative Reuse</h2>
    <p>
      Upcycling is the art of turning waste into value. From fashion accessories made of discarded fabric to furniture crafted from pallets, youth are blending sustainability with creativity. These projects often double as income-generating ventures and awareness tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Community Clean-Up Drives</h2>
    <p>
      Clean-up drives are powerful tools for engagement. Whether it’s a mangrove forest, a school campus, or a village lane, these events bring people together. Youth leaders are using social media to mobilize volunteers, track impact, and build momentum for long-term change.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy & Advocacy</h2>
    <p>
      Young voices are influencing waste policy at the grassroots. From petitioning for better waste collection to proposing plastic bans in school canteens, youth are shaping the rules that govern their environment. Digital storytelling and data visualization are amplifying their reach.
    </p>

    <h2>Innovation in Waste Tech</h2>
    <p>
      Students are prototyping low-cost waste sorters, IoT-enabled bins, and mobile apps for reporting illegal dumping. Hackathons and maker spaces are becoming launchpads for scalable solutions that blend tech with sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you're a student, teacher, or community member, you can be part of the solution. Start by auditing your own waste, join a local clean-up, or launch a campaign in your school. Every action counts—and when youth lead, change accelerates.
